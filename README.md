# Introduction

The world of business thrives on data-driven decisions, and the ability to harness the power of data is essential. In this project, we embark on an exciting journey to analyze sales data, uncover trends, and reveal valuable insights that will drive strategic decision-making. 

Our primary goal is to extract actionable information from a substantial sales dataset, providing a roadmap for optimizing sales strategies and achieving sustainable growth

# Description

Within the realm of this project, we will delve deep into a vast repository of sales data, armed with analytical tools and techniques. Our mission is to unearth the hidden gems that lie within these numbers. We will scrutinize sales trends, identify star-performing products, and meticulously calculate essential revenue metrics, including total sales and Average revenue per Order. 

But we won't stop at just numbers; we will bring these insights to life through compelling visualizations that resonate with stakeholders




# About the Dataset

The dataset has sales data from January 2019 to January 2020. It consists originally of 6 columns which was modified further for the purpose of the analysis;

order_id: Unique identifier for each order placed by a customer

Product: Electronics Products sold by the store

quantity: Quantity ordered for each product

order_date: Date the order was placed 

Price Each: Price of each product in USD

# Business Task

Q1. What is the overall sales trend? 

Q2. What is the product performance by revenue?

# Analysis

The analysis was done using Microsoft Power BI.

## Steps

Data Import: I imported and converted the raw data which was in CSV file format into Microsoft Excel.

Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency this included standardizing the formats, and correcting errors.

Data Transformation: I transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis. This transformation includes calculations, aggregations, and filtering operations. I also created new columns required for the analysis using Microsoft Excel.

Data Visualization: Data Visualization: I visualized the analyzed data using the charts and graphs available on Microsoft Power BI. I also created a dashboard using the insights from the analyzed data.
